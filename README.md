# Spectrum_Analyzer_FPGA

- Contains a DDS core which generates and sinusoid and phase accumulator control module which controls the output of the DDS core (frequency, frequency step and total frequency range)
- Calculates Vpp (peak to peak voltage) from XADC and stops frequency sweep when Vpp dips below a certain voltage
